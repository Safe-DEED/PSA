node-seal is a homomorphic encryption library in JavaScript.

- **Web Assembly:** Fastest web implementation of the C++ [Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL) library
- **Zero dependencies:** Very lean, only contains a low level API which is very close to the C++ calls from Microsoft SEAL.
- **Node.js or the browser:** Install once, work in any server/client configuration.

**Now supporting Microsoft SEAL 3.5.8**

## Installation

node-seal can be installed with your favorite package manager:

```shell
npm install node-seal
```

```shell
yarn add node-seal
```

Import the library using `import` or `require` syntax:

```javascript
// Auto-detects browser or nodejs.
// Defaults to use the WASM build which throws on transparent ciphertexts
import { Seal } from 'node-seal'
const { Seal } = require('node-seal')
```

Specify a target environment. This is useful for environments that
aren't detected properly or do not support WebAssembly. In addition,
there are two separate bundles for throwing on transparent ciphertexts
and another for allowing transparent ciphertexts. If you're unsure what 
you need, start with the build that throws on transparent ciphertexts.
This is also the default import that is used.

```javascript
// Pick one that suits your need (throws on transparent ciphertexts)
import { Seal } from 'node-seal/dist/throws_transparent/node/wasm' // Specifies the WASM build for NodeJS
import { Seal } from 'node-seal/dist/throws_transparent/node/js' // Specifies the JS build for NodeJS
import { Seal } from 'node-seal/dist/throws_transparent/web/wasm' // Specifies the WASM build for the browser
import { Seal } from 'node-seal/dist/throws_transparent/web/js' // Specifies the JS build for the browser

// Pick one that suits your need (allows transparent ciphertexts)
import { Seal } from 'node-seal/dist/allows_transparent/node/wasm' // Specifies the WASM build for NodeJS
import { Seal } from 'node-seal/dist/allows_transparent/node/js' // Specifies the JS build for NodeJS
import { Seal } from 'node-seal/dist/allows_transparent/web/wasm' // Specifies the WASM build for the browser
import { Seal } from 'node-seal/dist/allows_transparent/web/js' // Specifies the JS build for the browser
```

#### React-Native

In react-native environments, there are two ways of using node-seal.

1. Load the pure JS build
2. Create a WebView and manage node-seal inside.

**Option 1** is the easiest method, but performance is
significantly reduced. Because emscripten expects either a NodeJS or Web environment,
loading node-seal will fail because it expects a browser global object that doesn't
not exist. The solution is to spoof the `document` object.

Simply add an empty `document` object to the `global` provided by react-native:

```javascript
import { Seal } from 'node-seal/dist/throws_transparent/web/js'
;(async () => {
  global.document = {} // mimic browser document
  const seal = await Seal()
})()
```

**Option 2** is harder to implement, but it will allow you to use the faster `dist/throws_transparent/web/wasm` build.
The implementation will need to manage the state within the WebView.

## Demo

Go to [morfix.io/sandbox](https://morfix.io/sandbox)

This sandbox was built for users to experiment and learn how to use Microsoft SEAL featuring node-seal.

- **Encryption Parameters:** experiment with many settings to prototype a context.
- **Keys:** Create, download, upload Secret/Public Keys - even for Relinearization and Galois Keys.
- **Variables:** Create, download, upload PlainTexts or CipherTexts
- **Functions:** Create a list of HE functions to execute!
- **Code Generation:** After your experimentation is complete, generate working code to use!

## Benchmarks

A set of benchmarks similar to the benchmarks of the native SEAL C++ code can be found [here](benchmark/).

Run them by cloning this repository and then run `npm run benchmark:bfv` or `npm run benchmark:ckks`.

The scripts are only for NodeJS. We have adapted a variant of this script for each browser and have shown the results in the section below.

## Caveats

Conversion from C++ to Web Assembly has some limitations:

- **Â±2^53 bit numbers:** JavaScript uses 2^53 numbers (not true 64 bit). Values higher than these
  will typically result in inaccuracies. `BFV` users will inherently adhere to these
  limitations due to the Int32/UInt32 TypedArrays. `CKKS` users will need to keep this in mind.
  There are extra methods that now support 64-bit integers using BigInt for `BFV` at a significant 
  performance penalty. However, `CKKS` is still limited to 2^53-bit precision.

- **Memory:** Generating large keys and saving them in the browser could be problematic.
  We can control NodeJS heap size, but not inside a user's browser.

  Saving keys is very memory intensive especially for `polyModulusDegrees`s above `16384`.
  This is because there's currently no way (that we have found) to use io streams
  across JS and Web Assembly code, so the strings have to be buffered completely in RAM and
  they can be very, very large. This holds especially true for `GaloisKeys` where you may hit
  JS max string limits (256MB).

- **Garbage Collection:** Unfortunately, the typical way of cleaning up dereferenced JS objects will
  leave behind a the Web Assembly (C++) object in memory. There is no way to automatically call the destructors
  on C++ objects. JavaScript code must explicitly delete any C++ object handles it has received, or the
  heap will grow indefinitely.

  ```javascript
  <instance>.delete()
  ```
